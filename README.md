# Student-Class-Registration-System-Backend

This is a processing back-end for student class registration

This backend will receive as input the key-value pairs
containing the data from the user-submitted form and will perform three primary functions:

● Verify student’s identification, a login system

● Search and output the class(es) information, for example, class numbers, class title,
instructor of this class, description, etc., according to certain conditions given by the
students (for example, campus information, semester information, department information,
etc.)

● Student registration management including adding class under some certain rules,
dropping registered class(es), modified registered class(es), giving an overview of the
registered classes.

● Administrator registration management including adding or deleting class(es) in the class
registration system’s database, modifying relevant information of the existing class(es).
